USERS ROLES
===========

Users are grouped into 3 types of roles, and one for myself;
I, as a Creator of the HUMINACT application, have exceptionally two roles to manage HUMINACT (Creator and Boss).


1 - Strangers
-------------

A Stranger is an anonyme user, visiting the application for the first time, or not yet registered.
He doesn't have the permissions to save its relations data to the database or change the behaviour of its HIA instance.
He can only give text to HIA to parse and stock in a temporary cache which is cleared at the end of his browser session.


2 - Friends
-----------

A Friend is a registered user on the HUMINACT website with his credentials: username, password and email.
All of his other informations are collected from his told information to HIA and saved to database.
A Friend can be remembered forever by HIA, and can have access to his data whenever he is connected to HIA from wherever.
He can only access data given by himself only, and some public data from other users if they wanted to share.


3 - Boss
--------

A Boss is an administrator of the application.
He has full access and all permissions to manage HIA memory and behaviour to make it better.


4 - Creator
-----------

A Creator is the one who created the application.
There can't be more than 1 Creator for the application.
