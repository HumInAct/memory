Friend
------

A friend is a registered user.
A user account is identified by its id, username and email.
User information is collected from its input to the properties.
Every user has a set of Nodes and Relations composing its own collection.
A user account is connected to the user's $user node information.


Node
----

A node is identified by its name and properties.
Node name is unique, there must not be 2 or more nodes with the same name, however there can be nodes containing the same node name at beginning.
Every node can have many child nodes.
A node cannot have more than one parent node.
A node name like ($user:father:name) has one parent node ($user:father) which has one parent ($user).
From a Node's name, we can extract the parent node ($user:father where parent->$user).

EXPS:
My father is John - $user:father ---> John
My father's car is a Mercedes - $user:father:car ---> Mercedes
