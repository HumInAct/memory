Bracket Labels


Clause Level

. S - simple declarative clause, i.e. one that is not introduced by a (possible empty) subordinating conjunction or a wh-word and that does not exhibit subject-verb inversion.
. SBAR - Clause introduced by a (possibly empty) subordinating conjunction.
. SBARQ - Direct question introduced by a wh-word or a wh-phrase. Indirect questions and relative clauses should be bracketed as SBAR, not SBARQ.
. SINV - Inverted declarative sentence, i.e. one in which the subject follows the tensed verb or modal.
. SQ - Inverted yes/no question, or main clause of a wh-question, following the wh-phrase in SBARQ.


Phrase Level

. ADJP - Adjective Phrase.
. ADVP - Adverb Phrase.
. CONJP - Conjunction Phrase.
. FRAG - Fragment.
. INTJ - Interjection. Corresponds approximately to the part-of-speech tag UH.
. LST - List marker. Includes surrounding punctuation.
. NAC - Not a Constituent; used to show the scope of certain prenominal modifiers within an NP.

. NX - Used within certain complex NPs to mark the head of the NP. Corresponds very roughly to N-bar level but used quite differently.
. PP - Prepositional Phrase.
. PRN - Parenthetical.

. QP - Quantifier Phrase (i.e. complex measure/amount phrase); used within NP.
. RRC - Reduced Relative Clause. 
. UCP - Unlike Coordinated Phrase. 
. VP - Verb Phrase. 
. WHADJP - Wh-adjective Phrase. Adjectival phrase containing a wh-adverb, as in how hot.
. WHAVP - Wh-adverb Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. May be null (containing the 0 complementizer) or lexical, containing a wh-adverb such as how or why.
. WHNP - Wh-noun Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. May be null (containing the 0 complementizer) or lexical, containing some wh-word, e.g. who, which book, whose daughter, none of which, or how many leopards.
. WHPP - Wh-prepositional Phrase. Prepositional phrase containing a wh-noun phrase (such as of which or by whose authority) that either introduces a PP gap or is contained by a WHNP.
. X - Unknown, uncertain, or unbracketable. X is often used for bracketing typos and in bracketing the...the-constructions.
